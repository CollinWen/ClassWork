/**
*	The Farmer Game program is a game simulation. There are four characters: 
*	a cabbage, a sheep, a wolf, and a human. The objective is to bring all four
*	characters across a river with only one boat. The boat can only hold two 
*	characters at once, and the human must always be on the boat when traveling
*	across. Only on animal can be brought over at a time. However, if the sheep
*	cabbage are left on the same side of the river without the human, the sheep
*	will eat the cabbage. If the wolf and the sheep are left on the same side 
*	of the river without the human, the wolf will eat the sheep. If any of the
*	two situations occurs, you will lose. Otherwise, if you successfully bring 
*	all four characters to one side, then you will win.
